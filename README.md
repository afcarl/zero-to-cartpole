# zero-to-cartpole
Swing up controller for cartpole.

See the document [From Zero to Cartpole](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~stephentu/writeups/zero-to-cartpole.pdf) for background on the derivation of the physics of the cartpole, and the LQR controller about the equilibrium. The swing-up controller comes from Russ Tedrake's [notes](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html?chapter=3) in Section 3.5.3.
